And I only keep the baddest bitches 'round me

Gucci on my coochie, glitter on my body, everybody wanna do me
A hood Mona Lisa, figure like somebody drew it
If I introduce you to this pussy, nigga, you gon' chew it, rub your waves while I do it
I know bitches I've influenced, I look different, they congruent
Post a pic up on the 'gram, then my DMs get to boomin'
"Hey bighead" and "What you doin'?", "Can I fly you out to Europe?"
"Do your pussy taste like gum 'cause I'm really tryna chew it?”
Hit 'em back like, “Who you bank with? Do you got a lady?
And if you do, can you still deposit my money safely?”
He watchin' all my videos just to watch me shake it
Damn I thought the nigga had a seizure, way he shakin'

Middle finger out the window when they lane switch (Lane switch)
